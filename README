My 433 Romance : Group Project - Alarm Clock

Running instructions:
This code is designed to compile and run on ARM linux architectures using arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc compiler.
It was tested and intended for the Beaglebone Green with an attached Zen Cape. It may not work with other configurations.

Steps to run:

Prerequisites:
- Follow additional instructions in makefile to configure audio
- The target must have an internet connection to run the web server
- Must have installed nodejs and npm to run the web server

1. Load the BB-I2C1 and BB-BONE-AUDI-02 capes
2. Compile the program by running 'make' inside the top directory
3. To run the program, './main' in the project folder and run 'node server.js' in the 'webapp/' folder

The web interface can then be accessed by a device on the same network as the node server @ [targetIP]:12345

Running Instructions:
After starting the app, the time can immediately be seen on the displays. The app is controlled by the joystick:

Push: Silence the alarm if it is playing
Right: Speak the time of the next alarm set
Down: Silence the alarm if it is playing, and set a new alarm for 5 minutes after (Snooze)

From the Web Server, a user can import alarms from their Google Calendar (follow the prompts) or by entering 
the time into the text fields and pressing 'Set Alarms'. Currently set alarms are seen at the bottom of the page.
